/**
 * The Link type defines a logical relationship between two items,
 * such as two ENTRYs or an ENTRY and a COMPOSITION. Links can be
 * used across compositions, and across EHRs. Links can potentially
 * be used between interior (ie non archetype root) nodes, although
 * this probably should be prevented in archetypes. Multiple LINKs
 * can be attached to the root object of any archetyped structure to
 * give the effect of a 1->N link.
 *
 * Instances of this class are immutable
