	WOUC, // Warning: A code in the ontology is not used.
	WACMC, //Not an official warning ... cardinality/occurrences validity edge case: where occurrences and cardinality are stated, the interval represented by: (sum of all occurrences minimum values) .. (sum of all occurrences maximum values) must intersect with the interval stated by the cardinality. This is fulfilled, but none of the optional elements could ever be added.

	/* Missing validation errors
	- VCAEX: archetype attribute reference model existence conformance: the existence
		of an attribute must conform, i.e. be the same or narrower, to the existence of
		the corresponding attribute in the underlying information model.
	
	- VCAM: archetype attribute reference model multiplicity conformance: the multiplicity,
		i.e. whether an attribute is multiply- or single-valued, of an attribute must conform
		to that of the corresponding attribute in the underlying information model.
		
	- VSSM: This seems to be ADL 1.5 specific. specialised archetype sibling marker validity: the sibling code used in a
		sibling marker in a specialised archetype must refer to a node found within the same
		container in the flat parent archetype.
		
		The following validity rule applies to CONSTRAINT_REFs in a specialised archetype.
	- VSCNR: placeholder constraint node conformance: a placeholder node can only
		be defined into a reference model type conformant with the type of the original constraint
		in the parent archetype.
		
	- VSONNC : not defined in specs, but seems to be the general error of non-conformance for specialised archetypes if nothing else fits (just in the algorithm for spec. validation as published in the specs).
